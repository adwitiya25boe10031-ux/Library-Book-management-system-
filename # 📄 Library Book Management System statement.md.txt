# 📄 Library Book Management System Documentation

## I. Project Statement of Purpose

This project is a fundamental **Library Book Management System** developed as an introduction to basic programming concepts.

The primary objective is to address the inefficiency and potential for error inherent in **manual book management** by providing a basic digital tool. The system serves as a simple, menu-driven solution implemented in Python, allowing users to **Add books**, **View the complete book list**, and **Search for books** by title or author.

By utilizing core programming elements like lists and dictionaries, the project successfully demonstrates the fundamentals of modular design and function implementation. Ultimately, this system provides a simple, accurate, and easy-to-use application that fulfills the need for basic library organization.
